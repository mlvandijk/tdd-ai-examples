# Examples to use for TDD or Test-First with AI

Try them out with [JetBrains AI Assistant](https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/) or [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/) coding agent.

## Example 1: FizzBuzz

### With AI Assistant
* Open file `FizzBuzzTest`
* Open AI Assistant chat
* Ask AI Assistant: "Implement code that passes the tests"
* Make sure the file is attached to the prompt
* Copy the provided code to the right location
* Run tests

### With Junie
* Ask Junie: "Implement code that passes the tests in FizzBuzzTest.java"
* Click "Run tests" when Junie asks to run the tests

## Example 2: Calculator

### With AI Assistant
* Open file `CalculatorTest`
* Open AI Assistant chat
* Ask AI Assistant: "Implement code that passes the tests"
* Make sure the file is attached to the prompt
* Copy the provided code to the right location
* Run tests
**Note:** Since this example requires multiple classes/files to be created, AI Assistant isn't always able to solve it.

### With Junie
* Ask Junie: "Implement code that passes the tests in CalculatorTest.java"
* Click "Run tests" when Junie asks to run the tests
